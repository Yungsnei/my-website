    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone, my name is Mercidieu Alexis, I’m 22 years old, and I’m from Jacmel, Haiti. 
      I don’t really know where to begin because my life feels like a mystery. At the age of 2, I was living with my parents’ aunt and uncle. 
      A few months later, I was moved to a children’s village, and from there, I was moved again to another children’s village, where I was joined by my brother, Roosevelt.
       It was during this time that my life became intertwined with Hands and Feet Project (HAFP).
    </p>

    <p>When I first came to HAFP, there were less than 20 kids there, but now HAFP takes care of over 150 children.
       I grew up not knowing my real parents, but that didn’t change the fact that HAFP became my family, my home, and everything I ever wanted. 
       Before coming to HAFP, I wasn’t in school, and I didn’t know how to read. 
       But after just a few days at HAFP, I was already in school, starting from pre-kindergarten.
    </p>

    <p>Fifteen years later, I am a high school graduate, and now, I’m attending Trevecca Nazarene University.
       There’s been a lot of growth and change during those years.
    </p>

    <p>I’ve had big, crazy dreams, but without Jesus and the people at HAFP, they wouldn’t have come true. 
      Being a part of HAFP is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. It changed everything for me.
       I didn’t know what would happen if I hadn’t come to HAFP. My life would be completely different.
    </p>

    <p>When I was in high school, I knew I wanted to study Information Technology when I went to college, and now I have that chance.
       I love learning about IT and cybersecurity, and I’m determined to do everything I can to finish that dream and make even bigger dreams come true.
       I chose this career because I want to help people throughout my life, just like people have been helping me.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout my college years, I’ve also been part of the soccer team, and I plan to continue this passion.
       Being part of the soccer team has been a significant part of my college experience, and it has taught me a lot about teamwork, perseverance, and discipline.
        But more than that, it’s given me a chance to connect with others and stay active.
       I want to keep learning and growing in both IT and soccer because those are things I’m deeply passionate about.
    </p>

    <p>I know not everyone has the opportunity I’ve had, but I believe that God has a different plan for each of us.
       So, never give up on your dream.
    </p>
