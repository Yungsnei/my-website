      <h3>Phishing Email Detection System - Technical Demonstration</h3>
      <p>
        As part of a recent technical project, I developed a phishing email detection system using Python,
         incorporating tools such as <strong>Scikit-learn</strong>, <strong>NLTK</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>,
          <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and <strong>NumPy</strong>. This system is designed to help address the growing 
          business problem of phishing attacks targeting organizations and individuals. 
        In my demo, I walk through the story behind the project, the real-world impact of phishing, the intended 
        target market, and the reasons behind my technology choices.

        You can view the full project, including all source code and documentation, on my 
        GitHub repository.

      <h3>Previous projects</h3>
        <p>
          These are some of the early projects I worked on during my freshman year of college, 
          back when I was just beginning to learn how to code. 
          They reflect my initial steps into programming and problem-solving within the IT field.

          In the next section, you'll find a website I built entirely from scratch — a culmination of the knowledge and skills I've gained through 
          my coursework and hands-on experience over the years. 
          I appreciate you taking the time to explore my journey and see how far I’ve come in my growth as an IT professional.
